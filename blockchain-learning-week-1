## What is Blockchain?
A **Blockchain** is “a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, called blocks.” These blocks “are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.
A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network.

## Features

- **Immutable** : Immutability means that the blockchain is a permanent and unalterable network. Blockchain technology functions through a collection of nodes.
- **Distributed** - All network participants have a copy of the ledger for complete transparency. A public ledger will provide complete information about all the participants on the network and transactions. The distributed computational power across the computers ensures a better outcome. 
- **Decentralized** : Blockchain technology is a decentralized system, which means that there is no central authority controlling the network. Instead, the network is made up of a large number of nodes that work together to verify and validate transactions. Each and every node in the blockchain network will have the same copy of the ledger.

- **Secure** : All the records in the blockchain are individually encrypted. Using encryption adds another layer of security to the entire process on the blockchain network.
- **Consensus** : Every blockchain has a consensus to help the network to make quick and unbiased decisions. Consensus is a decision-making algorithm for the group of nodes active on the network to reach an agreement quickly and faster and for the smooth functioning of the system.
- **Unanimous** : Every record is updated simultaneously and the updations propagate quickly in the network. So it is not possible to make any change without consent from the majority of nodes in the network.
- **Faster Settlement** : Blockchain offers a faster settlement compared to traditional banking systems.


## How Blockchain differs from traditionl databases?
The main difference is centralization, while traditional databases were centralized means they were controlled by some individual or an authority which make them easy to tampered with. But the scenerio with Blockchain were different, being a decentralized tech made it nearly impossbile to tampere with by any other individual. That's why Blockchain is used in maintaining secure and decentralized records of [cryptocurrencies](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-a-cryptocurrency/) transactions. 

> **Facts!!** 
>  The Concept of Blockchain Has Been Around Since the Early 1980s : A quick glance at the history shows that the concept of a decentralised and distributed database of transactions was originally outlined in the early 1980s. However, it was only with a 1991 white paper by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta that the idea of how to time-stamp a digital document became reality. 
>And now As of 2023, there have been over 82 million Blockchain cryptocurrency wallet users


## 2. Working of Blockchain
**Transaction** : Blockchain transaction is nothing but data transmission across the network of computers in a blockchain system.
**How Blockchain Transaction works? !!**
This might be the question everyone thinks when trying to learn about blockchain, we will learn about it and cover everything about it in three stages: Transaction creation, verification, and block addition to the chain.
## Transaction Creation
**(i)** Transactions are initiated from users end who want to transfer digital assets or any digital info.
**(ii)** The user creates a transaction by specifying the sender, recipient, amount, and any additional data or conditions relevant to the specific blockchain application.
**(iii)** The transaction is done using the private key of the sender that acts as a unique identity proof of the sender.
## Transaction Verification
Blockchain transaction verification stands as a fundamental process intrinsic to the functioning of blockchain technology.
It facilitates the validation and addition of transactions to the blockchain ledger - a form of a digital and distributed ledger. Grasping the essence of this process is a step toward deciphering the multifaceted potential of blockchain technology.

## Block Addition to the Chain
There are different consensus mechanisms used to verify transactions and add new blocks to a blockchain. In cryptocurrency, the most common methods are proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.
We will soon learn about consensus mechanics.
## What are Miners & How they are important?
Miners are an essential part of the blockchain network. They are responsible for verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems that allow them to validate transactions.

In order to add a transaction to the blockchain, a miner must first verify that the transaction is valid. This involves checking that the sender has enough funds to complete the transaction and that the transaction has not already been recorded on the blockchain.

Once a miner has verified a transaction, they add it to a block along with other verified transactions. The miner then uses their computing power to solve a cryptographic puzzle that allows them to add the block to the blockchain. This process is called mining.
## Concept of Consensus
It is a algorithm that is used in transaction to meet a common agreement among users.
